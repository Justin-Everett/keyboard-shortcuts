# Keyboard Shortcuts IB CAS Project

This project was made for a scheme in the IB program called CAS, and was meant to teach both teachers and students at my previous school how to effectively use keyboard shortcuts, therefore increasing their technicalogical literacy.

The program is based heavily on a similar feature implemented by early chromebooks, which I was given in 2015 by my former school, on which I learned keyboard shortcuts very proficiently which propelled me above my peers in terms of computer literacy, which is why I wanted to build a similar program for other people to be able to run and learn from, as I see keyboard shortcuts to be extremely helpful.

The program works by essentially just substituting out different images, each displaying various keyboard shortcuts, depending on which activation key was pressed.
