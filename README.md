# Keyboard Shortcuts IB CAS Project

This project was made for a scheme in the IB program called CAS, and was meant to teach both teachers and students at my previous school how to effectively use keyboard shortcuts, therefore increasing their technicalogical literacy.

Unfortunately, upon graduating from the school I lost access to the project files and was only able to salvage the .jar and .exe files as I had downloaded those onto my laptop to save, which is what is in this repository.
